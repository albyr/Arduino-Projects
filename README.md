# Arduino-Projects
Home to my little tinkerings


This is a programme to run a child's toy which has 5 switches. Activiating each switch causes an led to flash the same number of times as the LED no (ie. LED 3 flashes 3 times)
When all switches are on then a more impressive light show happens.

Here is a link to the 123D simulation I have so far:
